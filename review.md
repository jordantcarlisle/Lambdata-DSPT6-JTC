Overall Score: 2

-Code layout easy to follow.

-Clear and concise

-Can be used and/or extended (with the completion of to_dataframe_column() function)


Great work, easy to read and understand. 

In to_dataframe_column(), you have: 
df = DataFram(X)

when I think you should have:
df = DataFrame(X)
